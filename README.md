## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

*   **Node.js** (v18 or later recommended) - [Download Here](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **npm** (comes with Node.js)
*   **Git** for version control - [Download Here](https://git-scm.com/)
*   **MongoDB Server** (or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
    *   For local development, you can install MongoDB Community Server: [Installation Guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)
    *   A GUI like **MongoDB Compass** is highly recommended for viewing data: [Download Here](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**
    *   Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    *   Install the required npm packages:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. Copy the contents from `.env.example` (or the block below) and fill in your details.
        ```
        # Create a new file named .env and add this content
        
        # Your MongoDB connection string (local or cloud)
        # For a local database, this is usually correct
        MONGO_DB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/social-connect-db

        # A strong, random secret key for signing JWTs
        # You can generate one by running `openssl rand -base64 32` in your terminal
        JWT_SECRET=your_super_strong_jwt_secret_key

        # The port your backend server will run on
        PORT=5000
        ```

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    *   Navigate to the frontend directory from the root folder:
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        ```
    *   Install the required npm packages:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

### Running the Application

You will need **three separate terminals** running simultaneously to launch the application.

1.  **Terminal 1: Start your MongoDB Server.**
    *   If you installed MongoDB locally, you'll need to start the service. On most systems, this is done with a command like:
        ```bash
        mongod
        ```

2.  **Terminal 2: Start the Backend Server.**
    *   Navigate to the `backend` directory and run:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    *   You should see the output: `Server is running on port 5000` and `Connected to MongoDB`.

3.  **Terminal 3: Start the Frontend Development Server.**
    *   Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   Your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:3000`, where you can see the application running.

You are now all set! You can create a few different user accounts to test the friend request and real-time chat functionality.
